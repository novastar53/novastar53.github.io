    "Mixture of Experts layers have become increasingly popular in newer large language models. However, the idea has been around for a while in different flavours. It can be traced to a 1989 paper by Hampshire and Waibel[1] which used a gating network to allocate cases to one or more expert networks. A 1990 paper by Jacobs, Jordan, Nowlan and Hinton[2] added the idea of making the gating network trainable using a supervised learning approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "By themselves, mixture of experts models are not very useful, since deep neural networks can easily learn to discriminate between training cases even without the explicit inductive bias provided by the mixture of experts architecture. However, when combined with the idea of sparse activations, they make it possible to train extremely large networks using comparatively fewer computations. This was demonstrated in the 2017 paper by Shazeer et al., [3] which used sparse mixture of experts layers to grow the size of the model while maintaining sub-linear growth in the activations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we will train a simple mixture of experts layer that learns to discriminate between different training cases. Each expert can be modeled using a feed-forward network, while the gating layer can be modeled using a softmax classifier. Sparsity is introduced using a Top-K function, which routes examples to only the K highest ranked experts for each example. However, this makes the model difficult to train, because the Top-K function is not differentiable. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we will avoid this problem by not using the Top-K function and smoothly allocating examples to experts based on the softmax weights. \n",
